üõ†Ô∏è Production Improvements:
- Add input validation (e.g., required fields like skills/salary)
- Use retry logic & backoff for API errors or timeouts
- Connect to Airtable or Postgres to store input/output (see Part 1 data model)
- Support multilingual JD generation using language selector
- Include recruiter feedback loop to rate outputs and fine-tune prompts

üîÑ Integration with Part 1 Airtable TRM:
- Employer briefs submitted via Typeform ‚Üí pushed to this JD generator
- Generated JDs saved back into Airtable and previewed in Stacker client portal
