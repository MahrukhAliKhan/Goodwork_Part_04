# 🛠️ AI Job Description Generator – Goodwork Prototype

This is a working prototype of the **Job Description Generator Agent** built as part of Goodwork’s multi-agent recruitment automation system. It uses OpenAI's GPT-4o to automatically create region-specific, inclusive, and optimized job descriptions based on employer input.

## 📌 Objective

Manually creating tailored job descriptions is time-consuming (2–3 hours per role). This AI agent automates that process by:

- Ingesting a structured employer brief
- Generating region-aware JDs (e.g., for Pakistan and the Philippines)
- Reflecting inclusive, diverse, and flexible work values
- Providing recruiters with polished drafts in minutes

## 🧠 Agent Functionality

- **Input**: Role, experience, key skills, location, company overview, salary
- **Process**: Prompted call to GPT-4o with structured data
- **Output**: 2 region-specific job descriptions (Pakistan and Philippines)
- **Tech Stack**: Python + OpenAI API (gpt-4o)
